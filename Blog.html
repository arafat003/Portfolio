            Artificial intelligence tells nightmare-inducing tales of terror
          </h1>
        <div ><img class="img-thumbnail " src="https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24143245/gettyimages-182993436.jpg?width=778" alt=""></div>  
          <p class="p-4">I remember his face in a look of horror, and it was agony and malice. I was trapped. I was trapped in this hospital bed.

            This isn’t the start of the latest Stephen King novel, it’s in fact the start of a horror story told by artificial intelligence.
            
            Shelley AI is currently working on a different short scary tale once an hour leading up to Halloween. It’s powered by deep learning algorithms that have been trained on stories collected from the subreddit /r/nosleep where people share their own original eerie works. The AI was created by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab.
            
            The AI works best when given a bit of inspiration so anyone can join in the story writing process to make it a joint effort. Collaborators simply add their own blood-curdling sentences to the compositions so far on Twitter and Shelley then continues from where they finish.
            
            Some of the best sinister snippets so far include:
            
            I heard my mother’s voice scream from the darkness. “God dad, please don’t hurt me again. Please don’t leave me alone. Please. I don’t want to be here anymore.” I turned to my left, and for a split second I could see it was her. After all that time, all I could make out were those black eyes above me.
            
            My heart is beating so fast it is a bit shorter than my breathing. I think I’m being stalked. I don’t know what happened to me, or why I was scared of it, but I need to know why. I need to know what happened.
            
            And my personal favourite:
            
            She fell to the floor from her cries and muttered a soft ‘Come to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
